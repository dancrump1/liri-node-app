Here is the start, user input, and results of utilizing LIRI.js
You begin by launching the application, Inquirer will prompt you for either:
1) Spotify 

or

2) Other

Selecting the first option will then result in Inquirer prompting you for a song to search for.  
Simply type in the name of a song, hit enter, and LIRI will return the information about that song.
